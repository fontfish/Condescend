## About

Condescend is designed as a simplified modern Garamond-style typeface,
especially suited for situations calling for a traditional serif design
but where kerning or OpenType features may not be accessible,
such as on some e-readers.

The Name Fish Condescend was chosen mostly at random.
“Fish” comes from the username FontFish while “Condescend” was chosen
because I decided that this design was to use only minimal kerning
and has no regard for the occasional uneven upper-lower-case pair.
It also serves as a pun on the word “descender”.
