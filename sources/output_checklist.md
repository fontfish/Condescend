# Output Checklist

## Things to do when outputting Fish Condescend fonts.

- Select “Å”, “Ç”, “ç”, “Ø”, “ø” and “Unlink Reference”.
- Select all and remove overlap.
- Add extrema.
- Round to integer. Remove overlap again for good measure.

#### Notes

Be careful of the italic lower-case “w” as adding extrema can cause one side to pull out of shape.

Be careful of the roman capital “Q” as adding extrema can cause the tail to pull out of shape.

## To Do

- Scale dot on exclamation mark up by a tiny amount. Remember inverted exclamation mark and question marks too.
