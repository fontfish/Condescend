# Output Checklist

## Things to do when outputting Fish Condescend fonts.

- Select “Å”, “Ç”, “ç”, “Ø”, “ø” and “Unlink Reference”.
- Select all and remove overlap.
- Add extrema.
- Round to integer. Remove overlap again for good measure.

#### Notes

Be careful of the italic lower-case “w” as adding extrema can cause one side to pull out of shape.
