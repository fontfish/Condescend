Notes and Edit Recommendations

This font is, for the needs of the creator, functionally complete.

If you have any suggestions or simply require the addition of a few accented glyphs,
contact me via GitHib or open an issue there (https://github.com/fontfish/Condescend/issues).

If you require more significant modifications, such as an entire alphabet or Unicode block,
it is recommended that you create a derivative work.
For linguistic purposes, you will likely understand the accents and letters you require better than I do.

(I don't fully understand how the Reserved Font Name field works, but my suggestion for any derivatives of this font that retain the style and design of the core character set and are indended only to expand upon the existing features or character set, is to remove the "Fish" from the name and replace it with an appropriate identifying prefix.)
